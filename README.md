# React Guess Game

This is a simple guess game I tried after I saw the same game which is implemented in khan academy.

react is fun doing projects like this, **now react is getting fucked by next** and there is no fun doing projects in react anymore, when i first learn react i was overwhelmed by react. As a guy who worked majorly in javascript, after I worked in react I was astonished by its simpleness and its state management. I have made many projects using pure react library now i don't know how the future of react would be.
